# Email_Scraping
This code will guide you in extracting email information.
For this code to work, you need to have the Outlook application installed and replace the example information in the code with your own.

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, you must install the required libraries: pywin32 (for win32com.client) and pandas, while datetime is a built-in library and does not require installation. You can install the necessary dependencies using the command pip install <library_name>.

# Comments:
This project was useful and applied to one of my needs, where I was required to collect data from received emails containing standardized responses from a conducted survey. I hope this can help you as well.
